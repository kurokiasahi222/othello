To play the game, clone or fork the repo. And run
```
python othello_main.py
```

I wrote this program for a project in __CSCI1913__: Introduction to Algorithms, Data Structures, and Program Development at the University of Minnesota.
<br/>
It is the __first project__ that I wrote during my coding and computer science career! At the time, this felt daunting and crazy difficult. 
It is really fun to see how much I improved throughout my career!
