# Othello program in python

This repo contains a simple Othello program written in Python. I wrote this program for a project in CSCI1913: Introduction to Algorithms, Data Structures, and Program Development at the University of Minnesota.
It is the __first__ ever "project" that I wrote during my coding and computer science career!
